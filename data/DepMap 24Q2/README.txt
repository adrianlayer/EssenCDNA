### Achilles

This Achilles dataset contains the results of genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens for Achilles (using Avana Cas9 and Humagne-CD Cas12 libraries) and Achilles combined with Sanger's Project SCORE (KY Cas9 library) screens.  

The dataset was processed using the following steps:
- Sum raw readcounts by SequenceID and collapse pDNAs by median (removing sequences with fingerprinting issues, total reads below 500000 or less then 25 mean reads per guide)
- Normalize readcounts such that pDNA sequences have the same mode, and all other sequences have median of nonessentials that matches the median of nonessentials in the corresponding pDNA batch
- Remove intergenic/non-targeting controls, Cas9 guides with multiple alignments to a gene, guides with >5 genomic alignments, and sgRNAs with inconsistent signal (see DropReason of guide maps).
- NA sgRNAs with pDNA counts less than one millionth of the pDNA pool
- Calculate the mean reads per guide for each sequence. Sequences with more then 185 mean reads per guide are considered passing.
- Compute the log2-fold-change (LFC) from pDNA counts for each sequence. Collapse to a gene-level by taking the median of guides.
- Calculate the Null-Normalized Median Difference (NNMD) from the LFC using the following equation: (median(essentials) - medain(nonessentials)) / MAD(nonessentials).  Sequences must be below a threshold of -1.25 to be considered passing.
- Calculate the fraction of reads originating from the other library than what is annotated. The fraction of reads must be below a threshold of 0.1 to be considered passing.
- Calculate residual LFC for each library and replicate by creating a linear model of the replicate's LFC as a function of the mean LFC across replicates. Only genes that show high variance in gene effect across screens and libraries are considered when calculating residual LFC.
- Remove sequences that do not have a Pearson coefficient > .19 with at least one other replicate sequence for the screen using the residual LFC. Remove sequences that have a Pearson coefficient > .8 with any other sequence that is not part of the same screen.
- Calculate the NNMD for each screen after averaging passing sequences. Screen must be below a threshold of -1.25 to be considered passing.
- NA out readcounts for pDNAs which correspond with a SNP in any guide in a vector for a given cell line (to correct ancestry bias), then recompute LFC.
- Compute the naive gene score by collapsing the passing LFC data to a screen x gene matrix.
- Prior to running Chronos, NA apparent outgrowths in readcounts.
- Run Chronos per library-screen type to generate screen-level gene effect scores, apply copy number correction, then scale such that median of common essentials is at -1.0 and median of nonessentials is at 0, and correct for screen quality. Concatenate gene effects from all libraries into a single ScreenGeneEffect matrix.
- Run Chronos jointly on all libraries-screen types to generate model-level gene effect scores, apply copy correction, scale, and correct screen quality as described above.  This produces the integrated CRISPRGeneEffect matrix using Chronos's innate batch correction.
- Using the CRISPRGeneEffect, identify pan-dependent genes as those for whom 90% of cell lines rank the gene above a given dependency cutoff. The cutoff is determined from the central minimum in a histogram of gene ranks in their 90th percentile least dependent line.
- For each Chronos gene effect score from both the ScreenGeneEffect and CRISPRGeneEffect, infer the probability that the score represents a true dependency. This is done using an EM step until convergence independently in each screen/model. The dependent distribution is given by the list of essential genes. The null distribution is determined from unexpressed gene scores in those cell lines that have expression data available, and from the nonessential gene list in the remainder.
The essential  and nonessential controls used throughout the analysis are the Hart reference nonessentials and the intersection of the Hart and Blomen essentials. See Hart et al., Mol. Syst. Biol, 2014 and Blomen et al., Science, 2015. They are provided with this release as AchillesCommonEssentialControls.csv and AchillesNonessentialControls.csv.

### Expression

DepMap expression data is quantified from RNAseq files using the GTEx pipelines. A detailed description of the pipelines and tool versions can be found here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/ccle_processing. These are aligned to hg38.

### Copy number

DepMap WGS/WES relative copy number data is generated by running the GATK copy number pipeline aligned to hg38. Tutorials and descriptions of this method can be found here https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/article?id=11682, https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/article?id=11683.
Absolute copy number data from WGS/WES is generated using PureCN (https://scfbm.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13029-016-0060-z).

### Mutations

DepMap mutation calls are generated using Mutect2 and annotated and filtered downstream. Variants are aligned to hg38. Detailed documentation can be found here https://storage.googleapis.com/shared-portal-files/Tools/24Q2_Mutation_Pipeline_Documentation.pdf.

### Fusions

DepMap generates RNAseq based fusion calls using the STAR-Fusion pipeline. A comprehensive overview of how the STAR-Fusion pipeline works can be found here: https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion/wiki. We run STAR-Fusion version 1.6.0 using the plug-n-play resources available in the STAR-Fusion docs for gencode v29. We run the fusion calling with default parameters except we add the --no_annotation_filter and --min_FFPM 0 arguments to prevent filtering.

Details on specific parameters we use to run PureCN can be found in our git repository: https://github.com/broadinstitute/depmap_omics/blob/dev/WGS_pipeline/PureCN_pipeline/README.md.

Genes that overlap with segmental duplication regions and/or flagged by repeatMasker are masked in this matrix. For details see https://github.com/broadinstitute/depmap_omics/blob/master/docs/source/dna.md#masking .

Inferred from WGS or WES depending on the availability of the data type. Values are calculated by mapping genes onto the segment level calls and selecting the copy number from the segment that has the greatest overlap with each gene.

- ModelID

**Columns:**

- Genes (HGNC symbol and Entrez ID)
